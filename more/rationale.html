                    <p>The Siboro Institute is set up to contribute to the public by its philosophy, i.e., "to make man whole".
                    
                    This is expressed more fully in these words of America’s most translated writer, Ellen G. White, about education:
                    
                    "True education means more than the pursual of a certain course of study. It means more than a preparation for the life that now is. It has to do with the whole being, and with the whole period of existence possible to man. It is the harmonious development of the physical, the mental, and the spiritual powers. It prepares the student for the joy of service in this world and for the higher joy of wider service in the world to come." (Ellen G. White, Education, 1903, Chapter 1)</p>

                    <p>Herbert Spencer, 19th century British philosopher, in his book "Education: intellectual, moral, and physical" asked a probing question "What knowledge is of most worth?" to which he answered science. Ellen G. White, on the other hand, stated that the knowledge that makes man whole is of most worth. We at Sibernetika is working on various avenues to harmoniously develop the physical, mental and spiritual powers of the people. Physical education is education of the body. Mental education is education of the mind. Spiritual education is education of the heart. Physical, mental and spiritual powers are, however, affecting each other and inseparable.
                    </p>
                    
                     <p>Sibernetika currently focuses its activities toward Indonesians or Indonesian language speakers, which is world’s fourth largest population. Sibernetika based its activities on the concept of balanced and harmonious development of human’s physical, mental and spiritual powers, which will nurture its social well-being.</p>

                <div class="feature_item top_featured">
                    <p>Health is not everything but everything is nothing without health. We believe simple and natural habits and remedies are the cheapest and best way to regain and preserve health. "Pure air, sunlight, abstemiousness [avoiding things that are harmful], rest, exercise, proper diet, the use of water, [and] trust in divine power--these are the true remedies....Those who persevere in obedience to her laws will reap the reward in health of body and health of mind." (Ellen G. White, 1905)</p>
